Despite the troubling numbers from China's outbreak, they were not as bad as people think. In China, over 3/4 of cases were in Hubei Province, where Wuhan city is. Within Hubei, 50,000 cases were from Wuhan City, making up over 60% of cases in a country.

The scale is easier to see stacked together:

- 1,300,000,000 people in China
- 50,000 in Wuhan city alone

Even if official numbers are under represented, no major city in China even crossed 2000 cases. When you line up the numbers, it's easy to see that the percentage of people *infected* were minimal, though absolutely everyone was *affected*, and remains affected. [Aside: [The Economist has a great episode](https://play.acast.com/s/theintelligencepodcast/c8f11d9a-1071-4307-b390-20a747796a61) that covers the threat Covid-19 had on planting season, agriculture, and therefore potential food shortages.]

I've had people who have asked me what China and Hong Kong have done for Covid-19.
