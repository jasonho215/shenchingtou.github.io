Being Asian may be an identity or an experience a based on how we look. Asia spreads from Turkey through the Middle East, over to Japan, and down the Asia Pacific reaching towards Australia. In reality, it is a region that has virtually every shade of skin, and too many languages and dishes to count.

Whether you are new to Berlin or have grown up in the city, if you identify as Asian, broadly defined, you are welcome in this community. 

**Since January, Asians have been experiencing much more racism and discrimination. Business is tough as it is, but Asian businesses will suffer doubly. Whatever your background, if you are going to #SupportYourLocal businesses, please seek out Asian ones to support as well. Thank you!**

If you have someone to add, please contact Athena on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/@shenchingtou) or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/thecupandtheroad). Thanks!

**Please consider supporting your neighbourhood grocery stores and Asian corner stores.**

Like many other businesses in Berlin, a number of restaurants or catering businesses are offering delivery. Please consider ordering from these places so they can survive and re-open after Covid-19 passes.
